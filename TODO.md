# Project roadmap

## Semantic annotations
  * [ ] Annotations that define (and document) how the annotated element
        interfaces with the outer world (e.g. user-oriented endpoints, 
        filesystem interfaces)
  * [ ] Test qualifiers (e.g. regression tests, smoke tests)

## Simple tools
  * [ ] Helper that maintains series of `AutoCloseable` objects

## Logging
  * [ ] Fluent logging API
  * [ ] LogBack buffering appender
  * [ ] Test-time appender that crashes the test if a message of a certain
        level is logged

## Feature Toggle
  * [ ] Annotation-based feature toggle
  * [ ] Feature toggle code instrumentation
